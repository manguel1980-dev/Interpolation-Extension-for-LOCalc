Interpolation Add-In:

The objective of this add-in is to create an interpolations functions.

All functions are developed to behave in the same way that the interpolation add-in created by Jose Ivan Martinez Garcia for Excel.
It will make possible a kind of interoperability among LibreOffice-Calc, Google-sheet in interpolation matter.

The Help for this Interpolation Addin can be found published in https://sites.google.com/view/interpolation/home
